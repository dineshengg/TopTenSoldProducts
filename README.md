# TopTenSoldProducts
In any ecommerce site like amazon or flipkart list top ten products sold at any given point of time

For example in amazon or flipkart we may need to design a feature that get top ten sold products at any point of time. The idea is to go back in time to get the last one hour products sold and based on the id of the product use data structure to count the no of products sold for that product id. Then sort it to get top ten products sold.

I have written the code for the same in c++. I need your review to check if there is any problem in the code. Also need your opinion if there is any particular data structure I can use to reduce the space and time complexity in getting top ten products. The code I have written in not a structured code how ever it works the way its needed. I can redesign based on your suggestion.
